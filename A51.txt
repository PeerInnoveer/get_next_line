In the middle of the barren
Nevada desert, there's a dusty
unmarked road that leads to the front gate of Area 51.
It's protected by little more than a chain
link fence, a boom gate, and intimidating trespassing signs.
One would think that America's much mythicized top
secret military base would be under closer guard, but make no mistake
They are watching.
